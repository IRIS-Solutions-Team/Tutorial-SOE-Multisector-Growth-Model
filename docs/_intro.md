# Overview of an illustrative BGP SOE model with mutliple sources of real growth

![[title-page]]

---

## Model sectors

* Households

* Local production

* Non-commodity exports

* Monetary Policy

* International trade and finance

* Rest of world


---

## Independent sources of real growth

* Productivity process in local production

* Productivity process in non-commodity export production

* Terms of trade


---

## Additional sources of unit roots

* General nominal price level in local economy

* General nominal price level in rest of world

* Definition of GDP

## Critical elements in building BGP models

* No need to stationarize models: valid steady state (BGP) and valid local approximation exist for the original levels

* Necessary condition: All nominal flows and nominal stocks must be growing
  at the same rate in steady state

* Steady-state growth differentials between different quantities must be
  exactly "offset" by the growth differentials in the respective relative
  prices

* Implications for model design: Long-run elasticities of substitution must
  be exactly $1$

* Use of production (and/or utility) functions with time-varying
  elasticities of substitution comes in handy: Cobb-Douglas with adjustment
  costs, utility with deep habits, etc.
